# Unity Submission by Utku Alkan and Frieda Hentschel

This zip-file contains a DemoProject: It is a URP project containing the *ProceduralShaderFrameworkPackage* amongst the assets. 

This is the folder that is used to create the UPM package. It was used to build the mentioned user shaders. Upon locating the Samples-folder, the corresponding user shader can be viewed in its scene. **Note that all #include-paths are different compared to the ones noted in the documentation. They should now be `#include "Assets/ProceduralShaderFrameworkPackage/Runtime/scripts/..."`.
