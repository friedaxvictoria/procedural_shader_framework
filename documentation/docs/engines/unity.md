# 🎮 Unity Shader Integrations

Unity is a versatile real-time engine known for its **Shader Graph system**, **cross-platform support**, and ease of integration for custom shaders.
Unity implementations use **Shader Graph** or custom HLSL in the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.
---

### 🧠 Engine Overview

- **Render Pipelines:** URP (Universal Render Pipeline), HDRP, Built-in  
- **Shader Language:** HLSL, ShaderLab  
- **Integration Method:** Shader Graph or Custom HLSL  
- **Ideal For:** Mobile, indie, cross-platform projects  
- **Real-Time Preview:** ✅ Yes  
- **Visual Editing:** ✅ Shader Graph with node-based workflow  

> Unity’s flexibility makes it a top choice for procedural visual effects and fast prototyping.
