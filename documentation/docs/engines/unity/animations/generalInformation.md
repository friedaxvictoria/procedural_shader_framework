The animation functions are used to periodically alter parameters of an object. They can be applied to [SDFs](../sdfs/generalInformation.md) or [Lighting Functions](../lighting/generalInformation.md) by connecting their output to the input of an object.

Animations are designed to alter parameters such as:

- Position
- Axis
- Angle
- Color
- Size
- Radius
- ...

## How to Combine Animations

Animations of the same dimension can simply be combined by connecting the functions in series.
