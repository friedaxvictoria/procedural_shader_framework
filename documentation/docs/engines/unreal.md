# ðŸŽ® Unreal Engine Shader Integrations

Unreal implementations are built using the **Material Editor**, with node-based logic and optional HLSL custom expressions.

Unreal Engine is a high-fidelity engine used in AAA games and cinematic visuals. It supports complex materials via the **Material Editor** and HLSL expressions.

---

### ðŸ§  Engine Overview

- **Rendering Pipeline:** Forward+ / Deferred / Lumen  
- **Shader Language:** HLSL (via Material Expressions)  
- **Integration Method:** Material Editor + Custom Nodes  
- **Ideal For:** Photorealism, cinematic FX, AAA games  
- **Real-Time Preview:** âœ… Yes  
- **Visual Editing:** âœ… Highly advanced material graph  

> Unrealâ€™s powerful editor is ideal for performance-heavy and cinematic procedural shaders.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Use **Material Function** assets for modularity.
- Supports Post-Process Materials.
- Good for performance-tuned projects.

---

## ðŸ§  Material Graph Logic

- Time input (from Blueprint or `Time` node)
- Use `Sine`, `Cosine`, `Add`, `Multiply` nodes
- Material Function to encapsulate `tiePos()` logic
