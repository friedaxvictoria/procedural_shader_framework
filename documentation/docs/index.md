# Procedural Shader Documentation

Welcome to the Shader Snippets Documentation! This site collects **procedural shaders** that create visual effects, like patterns or colors, on a full-screen rectangle (called a quad). Our shaders are written in **GLSL** (used in Shadertoy and WebGL) and **HLSL** (used in Unreal Engine and Unity).

## What’s This About?
Our goal is to make it easy to understand and reuse shaders that draw cool visuals without 3D objects in the scene. For example:
- A shader might fill the screen with a gradient or checkerboard pattern.
- In Unreal Engine, we use **Post Process Materials** to apply these shaders to the entire screen.
- In Shadertoy, shaders automatically draw on a full-screen quad.

## What’s Next?
- Browse shaders in the **Shaders** section, organized by type (e.g., patterns, effects).
- Learn how to set up shaders in Unreal Engine or other platforms.
- Watch video demos to see shaders in action.
