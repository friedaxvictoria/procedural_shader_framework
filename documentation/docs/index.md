# 🎨 Procedural Shader Development Documentation

Welcome to the **Shader Snippets Documentation Site** — a collaborative knowledge base for procedural shaders used in multiple engines including **Unreal**, **Unity**, and **Godot**.

## 🧠 What Are Shaders?

**Shaders** are small programs that run on the GPU to control how objects are drawn on the screen — controlling color, shape, lighting, animation, and more. Procedural shaders use **mathematical functions** to generate visuals dynamically without relying on textures or models.

---

## 🕹️ What Are Game Engines?

Game engines like **Unity**, **Unreal Engine**, and **Godot** provide tools and runtimes for rendering 2D/3D scenes. Each engine supports its own shader system:

- **Unreal:** Uses Material Editor with optional HLSL for advanced effects
- **Unity:** Supports Shader Graph and HLSL via ShaderLab
- **Godot:** Uses a GLSL-inspired shading language and integrates with GDScript for control

---

## 🔄 How Are Shaders Rendered in Engines?

Engines convert your shader logic into **renderable materials** that can be applied to objects in the scene. Each engine may use:
- **Visual Node Graphs** (like Shader Graph in Unity or Material Editor in Unreal)
- **Code-based shaders** (HLSL, GLSL, or Godot Shading Language)
- **Runtime scripting** to animate or parameterize shader behavior

This documentation bridges that gap — taking reusable shader logic and adapting it to each platform’s workflow. This documentation helps shader developers and engine integrators:

- Understand how each shader works (algorithm, parameters, results).
- Learn how to use these shaders in different game engines.
- Explore visual demos and integration walkthroughs.
