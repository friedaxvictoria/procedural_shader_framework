# 🎨 Procedural Shader Documentation

Welcome to the **Shader Snippets Documentation Site** — a collaborative knowledge base for procedural shaders used in multiple engines including **Unreal**, **Unity**, and **Godot**.

This documentation helps shader developers and engine integrators:
- Understand how each shader works (algorithm, parameters, results).
- Learn how to use these shaders in different game engines.
- Explore visual demos and integration walkthroughs.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

**🧱 Shaders**  
Browse all procedural shaders, organized by:

- **Type** (patterns, noise, lighting, etc.)
- **Algorithm breakdowns**
- **Result previews**

➡️ [Go to Shader Library](shaders/shaderPage.md)

---


**🧩 Engine Integration**  
Learn how to use shaders in:

➡️ [Unreal Engine](engines/enginePage.md)  
➡️ [Unity](engines/enginePage.md)  
➡️ [Godot](engines/enginePage.md)

Each section includes setup guides, shader-specific examples, and performance notes.
